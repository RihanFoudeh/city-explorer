## Overview

City Explorer is a website that allows the user to input a location name and it will show the location as a map image as well as providing the user with its logitude and latitude. We are creating it to make it easier for the user to search for a specific location.

## Getting Started

If the user would like to make a similar webapp all they have to do is:
   * Create a new repo on GitHub, initialized with no files.
   * Add React app to your project.
   * Once the React app is ready to go, start the coding process.
   * Use LocationIQ API.
